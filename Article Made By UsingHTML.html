    <h1>AI Program Finds Thousands of Possible Psychedelics. Will They Lead to New Drugs?</h1>
    <h2>Researchers have doubted how useful AI protein-structure tool AlphaFold will be in discovering medicines—now they are learning how to deploy it effectively</h2>

        Researchers have used the protein-structure-prediction tool AlphaFold to identify hundreds of thousands of potential new psychedelic molecules — which could help to develop new kinds of antidepressant. The research shows, for the first time, that AlphaFold predictions — available at the touch of a button — can be just as useful for drug discovery as experimentally derived protein structures, which can take months, or even years, to determine.
        The development is a boost for AlphaFold, the artificial-intelligence (AI) tool developed by DeepMind in London that has been a game changer in biology. The public AlphaFold database holds structure predictions for nearly every known protein. Protein structures of molecules implicated in disease are used in the pharmaceutical industry to identify and improve promising medicines. But some scientists had been starting to doubt whether AlphaFold’s predictions could stand in for gold standard experimental models in the hunt for new drugs.

    <b>ALPHAFOLD SPECTISM:</b>

<p>Efforts to apply AlphaFold to finding new drugs have been met with considerable scepticism, says Brian Shoichet, a pharmaceutical chemist at the University of California, San Francisco. “There is a lot of hype. Whenever anybody says ‘such and such is going to revolutionize drug discovery,’ it warrants some scepticism.”</p>

<p>Researchers led by Shoichet and Bryan Roth, a structural biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, came to a similar conclusion when they checked AlphaFold structures of two proteins implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions against known drugs. The researchers wondered whether small differences from experimental structures might cause the predicted structures to miss certain compounds that bind to proteins — but also make them able to identify different ones that were no less promising.</p>
<h5>DRUG DIFFERENCES:</h5>

<h5>Drug use leading to death </h5>
<p>23 cases are demonstrated, in which the connection between drug use and sudden death is to be accepted. The victims are only males and juveniles. It is demonstrated by the cases reported, that upon the sudden death of a juvenile increased consideration must also be given to a possible connection between death and drug use. First and foremost the drug used is susceptible of leading to death by way of an intoxication due to too large a dosage or owing to oversensitiveness. Far advanced putrefaction, the combined effects of several drugs including alcohol, the difficulty in furnishing chemical proof of the presence of hashish and LSD in body-fluids and organs can make it nearly impossible to clarify the cause of death.
